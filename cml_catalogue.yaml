      This project demonstrates how to build a logistic regression classification model to predict the 
      probability that a group of customers will churn from a fictitious telecommunications company. In 
      addition, the model is interpreted using a technique called Local Interpretable Model-agnostic 
      Explanations (LIME). Both the logistic regression and LIME models are deployed using CML's real-time model 
      deployment capability and interact with a basic Flask-based web application.
